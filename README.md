## üîß Configuration Options

### Vehicle Types
- **Self-owned**: Lower cost for optimization (default: 10 PKR/km)
- **Rented**: Higher cost penalty to minimize usage (default: 15 PKR/km)

### Capacity Constraints
- **Strict Validation**: Routes are validated to prevent over-capacity violations
- **Smart Consolidation**: System attempts to minimize vehicles used while respecting limits
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides warnings for any constraint violations
- **Worker Assignment**: Each pickup_spot's workers assigned to single vehicle for efficiency

### Optimization Algorithm
- **ALNS Method**: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search with 100 iterations
- **Greedy Initialization**: Fast initial solution construction
- **Destroy/Repair Operators**: Iteratively improves routes by removing and reinserting pickup_spots
- **Vehicle Penalty**: 1000 PKR per vehicle to encourage route consolidation
- **Distance Calculation**: Haversine formula for accurate geographic distances

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Import uvicorn could not be resolved"**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **"No solution found" or "Capacity violations"**
   - Check if total vehicle capacity >= total employee demand
   - Verify all locations have valid coordinates
   - Review capacity warnings in browser console
   - Ensure no single pickup_spot exceeds maximum vehicle capacity

3. **"Some workers unassigned"**
   - Total demand exceeds available capacity
   - Add more vehicles or increase vehicle capacities
   - Check detailed logs for specific capacity issues

4. **Map not loading**
   - Ensure internet connection for map tiles
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

5. **Routes not showing on map**
   - Ensure optimization has been run successfully
   - Check that pickup_spot map is visible
   - Verify browser console for visualization errors

### Performance Tips
- Use bulk addition for multiple vehicles/pickup_spots
- ALNS algorithm typically solves in 1-5 seconds for most problems
- Regularly clear browser cache if experiencing issues
- Review capacity constraints before optimization to avoid issues

## üöó Example Scenarios

### Small Company (5 vehicles, 10 pickup_spots)
- Typical solving time: 1-2 seconds
- Algorithm: ALNS with 100 iterations

### Medium Company (15 vehicles, 30 pickup_spots)
- Typical solving time: 2-4 seconds
- Algorithm: ALNS with 100 iterations

### Large Company (30+ vehicles, 50+ pickup_spots)
- Typical solving time: 3-6 seconds
- Algorithm: ALNS with 100 iterations

## üéØ Algorithm Details

### ALNS (Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search)
The system uses a sophisticated ALNS algorithm with the following characteristics:

1. **Greedy Initial Solution**: Fast construction of initial routes
2. **Destroy Operators**: 
   - Random removal of pickup_spots from routes
   - Worst-cost pickup_spot removal
3. **Repair Operators**:
   - Greedy insertion with capacity validation
   - Cost-based placement
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Simulated annealing-style acceptance
5. **Route Consolidation**: Post-optimization vehicle minimization

### Cost Function
- Distance cost: `distance √ó cost_per_km`
- Vehicle penalty: 1000 PKR per vehicle used
- Total cost = sum of all route costs + vehicle penalties
